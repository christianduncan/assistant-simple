One piece of the legislation addresses employers’ coverage of COVID-19 tests for their employees. Based on this action, all group health plans including self-funded and fully insured health plans must now cover the COVID-19 tests and related office visits (in-person or telehealth, urgent care or emergency room care) without cost sharing (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance), prior authorization, or other medical management requirements for their employees and covered dependents.   \nYour individual plan determines benefits and other services."

The pharmacist will observe as they swab themselves, then the individual will properly seal the swab in a container and plastic bag and drop their sample at a drop box as they pull out.
